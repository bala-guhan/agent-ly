OBJECTION HANDLING:

OBJECTION: "We already have an EHR system."
RESPONSE: "I understand. Many of our best customers came from [competitor name]. What they found was that while their legacy system worked, it wasn't optimized for [specific pain point mentioned earlier]. In our pilots, hospitals have seen [specific metric] improve by [X%] within 60 days. Would it make sense to at least explore if 2Care could complement or eventually replace parts of your current system?"

OBJECTION: "Your pricing is too high."
RESPONSE: "I appreciate that budget is a concern. Let me walk you through the ROI analysis we've prepared. Based on your current patient volume of [X], our customers typically see [Y] cost savings in the first 12 months through [specific savings area]. Additionally, the revenue optimization from better billing and reduced claim denials averages [Z]. When you look at total cost of ownership including your current system's maintenance, upgrade costs, and staff time, 2Care typically shows a positive ROI within 18 months. Would it help if we broke down these numbers together?"

OBJECTION: "We need to think about it / We're not ready yet."
RESPONSE: "Absolutely, this is a significant decision. To help with your evaluation, can I ask what specific areas you need more information on? [Wait for response]. Also, many hospitals find it helpful to start with a pilot program in one department rather than a full rollout. This allows you to validate the benefits with minimal risk and investment. Would a 30-day pilot in [their problem area] be a reasonable next step?"

OBJECTION: "We're concerned about data migration and downtime."
RESPONSE: "That's a very valid concern, and it's one we've addressed with our last 2,347 customers. Our implementation team has a proven methodology that ensures zero downtime during go-live. We migrate
